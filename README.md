Features
Supports 4 core features: Authentication, Post Creation, User Following, and Activity Feed Generation.
1) Authenticating Users — allows for a user to register for, log into, and deactivate an account.
2) Creating Posts — includes uploading photos with captions, and viewing previously uploaded photos on a profile page.
3) Supporting Followers — users can navigate to another user profile page and choose to follow them and their updates.
4) Supporting Feeds — on log in, a feed is generated that contains all the activity performed by users that you have chosen to follow. So if your app contains 4 users: A, B, C, and D — if you choose to follow users A and C your feed page should display only updates from users A and C but not updates from users B and D.
